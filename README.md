- Connecting wires
- HuskyLens device
- LED

## Requirements
- Install the HuskyLens library for Arduino
- Install the Arduino IDE
- Necessary wires for connecting components

## Steps
1. I Connecteded the LED to the Arduino board and the Breadboard.
2. I Connect the HuskyLens device to the Arduino board using appropriate wires (use Serial or I2C protocol as per the connection). I used I2C, with documented instructions provided in the references.
3. Set up the HuskyLens device to detect faces using the appropriate device settings.
4. Upload the code: **The code is included with the repository**.
